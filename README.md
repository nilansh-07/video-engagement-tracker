# ðŸŽ“ EduTrack: Intelligent Learning Progress Tracker

**EduTrack** is a smart, interactive lecture video tracker measuring genuine user engagement. Unlike traditional methods that mark videos as "watched" once played till the end, EduTrack calculates progress **only when unique, previously unseen parts** of a video are viewed. Ideal for modern e-learning platforms, this tool ensures that student interaction is both meaningful and measurable.

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Tracks **only new segments** of a video watched (avoids repeat inflation)
- âœ… **Prevents cheating** by skipping or rewatching previously watched content
- âœ… **Persists progress** across sessions using the browser `localStorage`
- âœ… **Resume playback** from the last watched position
- âœ… Live **progress indicator** updates in real-time
- âœ… Built with **React**, styled using **Tailwind CSS**
- âœ… Customizable **playback speed selector**

## ðŸ”  How It Works

### ðŸ“Š Unique Viewing Logic

- Tracks every watched segment as a time interval `[start, end]`
- On pause/end, merges overlapping intervals using a merge algorithm
- Progress is calculated as:

```text
(Unique seconds watched / Total video duration) * 100
```

### ðŸ”– Data Persistence

- All data (watched intervals, progress %, last position) saved in `localStorage`
- On reload, playback resumes and progress is re-rendered

## ðŸ“… Design Decisions

- Used `useRef` to directly access the video DOM
- Used `useEffect` to bind/unbind player events
- Saved intervals and progress in `localStorage` for simplicity
- Playback resume is implemented using the last watched time
- Tailwind CSS is used for consistent, responsive design
